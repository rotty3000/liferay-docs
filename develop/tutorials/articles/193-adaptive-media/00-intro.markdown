# Adaptive Media [](id=adaptive-media)

The Adaptive Media app on 
[Liferay Marketplace](https://web.liferay.com/marketplace) 
lets administrators tailor the quality of images in @product@ to the device 
viewing those images. For information on using this app, see 
[the Adaptive Media user guide](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/adapting-your-media-across-multiple-devices). 

But what if you want to leverage Adaptive Media in your own app? Then you're in 
the right place! The tutorials in this section explain how to use adapted images 
in your app. You'll also learn how to change Adaptive Media's image processing. 

Onwards!
