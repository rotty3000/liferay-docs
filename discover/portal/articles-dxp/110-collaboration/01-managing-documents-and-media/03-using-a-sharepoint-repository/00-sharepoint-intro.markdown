# Using a SharePoint Repository [](id=using-a-sharepoint-repository)

The 
[Liferay Marketplace](http://marketplace.liferay.com/) 
app *Liferay Connector for SharePoint* lets users add a SharePoint repository
type to @product@'s Documents and Media Library. It supports SharePoint 2013 and
SharePoint 2016.

**Note:** To access SharePoint 2010, you must use the Liferay Marketplace app 
*Liferay Connector for SharePoint 2010*.

**Note:** Liferay Connector for SharePoint uses Azure ACS with OAuth 2 for 
SharePoint server authorization. You must therefore enable HTTPS support in your 
app server. Consult your app server's documentation for instructions. For 
example, the required steps for Tomcat can be found in 
[its documentation](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.0-doc/ssl-howto.html).

Liferay Connector for SharePoint provides these key benefits: 

- Reading/writing documents and folders
- Document check-in, check-out, and undo check-out
- Downloading documents
- Moving folders and documents within the repository
- Getting revision history
- Reverting to a revision

The app uses SharePoint's API, which has these limitations: 

- Version history is lost when moving or renaming a file without first 
  checking it out.
- You can't change file extensions, you can only change file names.
- A file's current name propagates to all previous versions.
- The user who checks out a file is the only one who can see the version number 
  of that file's working copy.
- Queries for suffixes or intermediate wildcards convert to queries for 
  containment. 
- Comments, ratings, and using a SharePoint folder as a Documents and Media root 
  folder are unsupported. 

To use a SharePoint repository in Documents and Media, you must first create 
an application in SharePoint and authorize it to access the repository. The 
guides in this section walk you through this process.
