# Form Success Pages [](id=form-success-pages)

After users submit one of your whiz-bang forms, what's next? How will they know
they're done and can close the browser window or tab? What if they think their
submission didn't go through and wonder if they need to fill out the whole form
again? By default, submitting a form displays the default success message and 
returns users to the form's now empty first page. Don't leave users feeling 
equally empty. Instead, configure a *success page*. A success page is a terminal 
page showing users they've finished filling out the form and their submission
was successfully received. A success page can even urge users to close the
browser window or tab.

A success page is simple. It has a title in bold text and a description beneath 
the title. A common alternative to using a success page is to 
[redirect users to a different page in your Site](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/redirecting-users). 
What should you put in a success page? Whatever you want. If you can't think
of anything important or creative to say, use the default message:

To configure a success page, 

1.  Add a form in *Site Administration* (your site's menu) &rarr; *Content* 
    &rarr; *Forms*. 

2.  Click on the form page's *Actions* button 
    (![Actions](../../images/icon-actions.png)) 
    and choose *Add Success Page*.

Once the success page is added to your form, fill in the *Title* and 
*Description* fields however you please. When the form is saved and published, 
the success page is live for your form users.

**Note:** You can't preview the success page. Success pages can only be viewed 
once a form is submitted, and the *Submit* button isn't available in the form 
preview. The *Preview Form* link in the form builder only lets you preview the 
form's regular pages (use the *Next* button to navigate through the form). 

To see what your success page looks like, submit a test entry of the form and 
then delete it if needed. For more information, see 
[the documentation on viewing and managing form entries](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/managing-form-entries#viewing-form-entries).
